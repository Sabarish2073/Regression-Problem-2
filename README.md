# Regression-Problem-2

# Problem statement
Here, you are expected to predict the lifespan of the above organism given the data from three sensors.
In this case, the model is not linear. You are expected to try several (at least 3) non-linear regression
models on the train split and report the following metrics on the test split 
(a) Mean Squared Error, 
(b) Mean Absolute Error.

# Dataset: 
In Folder Shared look for file p2-train.csv to train the model and p2-test.csv to test the
model. Last column is the target value.

# Models to use: 
Suppot Vector Regression, Linear Regression (Use this for both the regression problem)
